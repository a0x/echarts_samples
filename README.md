# ECharts Tutorial from Scratch

This tutorial is made for those who are not familiar with any web techniques yet fantastic with dynamic charts, especially ECharts, and strongly willing to have a try.

In this case, I believe it is necessary to reduce the influence of lacking knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, which is why I did a couple of things as follows:

* Integrate ECharts and jQuery libraries as default.
* Simplify and standardize the folder structure, which is easy to learn and do as what it shows.
* Add a template for beginners, which will help them do other coding.

## Requirements

* Modern web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox
* Code editor, such as VS Code, Sublime Text (IDEs are not necessary at all.)

_Better to have Git installed on your computer._

## Coding & Browsing

Download the whole project and open the `.html` files in browser, and edit the `.js` files which have the same name with `.html` file, then enjoy the magic of ECharts.

Or, if you can't wait to try yourself, write your own charts just like `line-chart.js`, with the copy of the template.

Here's the [Echarts Official Site](http://echarts.baidu.com/index.html), you can find downloads and documents there, and anything related.

### II. Web basis

There is no doubt that you have to understand some basis of web programming, otherwise you will not master ECharts at all.
